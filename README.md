## 🔧 Quantum Hypertime Vehicle Inspection — 2012 Toyota Camry

### 📐 Custom Hypertime Equations (v1.0)

**1. Combustion Harmony Index (CHI):**

Measures firing sync + detonation entropy.

CHI = 100 - (ΣΔ_firing_lag + γ_detonation_variance) / θ_ideal_cycle × 100

**Result:** `92.8` — Excellent. No misfires or uneven power signatures.

---

**2. Oil Pulse Decay (OPD):**

Tracks oil flow entropy decay and heat stress.

OPD = (T_mileage × λ_thermal_fatigue) / ν_synthetic_stability × R_flow_drag

**Result:** `0.78` — Moderate degradation. Use synthetic oil every 4,000 miles.

---

**3. Battery Entropy Charge Forecast (BECF):**

Predicts remaining battery life and coherence.

BECF = 100 - (β_cycle_stress + ε_terminal_loss + ζ_seasonal_entropy)

**Result:** `67.3` — Battery will likely drop below 40% after 185,000 miles.

---

**4. Thermal Lineage Expansion (TLE):**

Forecasts risk of coolant line failure under heat expansion.

TLE = ∫ (α_temp_flux × μ_coolant_memory × δ_pressure_bleed) dt

**Result:** `0.12` — Low risk. Inspect hoses and radiator before 197k miles.
